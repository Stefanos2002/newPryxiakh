                Some of the best films of all time are those whose different
                strengths all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing
                whole. The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all
                excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts
                complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That
                is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates
                story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action
                gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward
                you with a deeper understanding of its characters and its
                expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful
                composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its
                design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways
                in both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse
                mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but
                thoughtfully reimagined character, God of War’s
                fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions.
                It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never cuts
                away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos’
                relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also
                encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world
                consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying
                combat.
