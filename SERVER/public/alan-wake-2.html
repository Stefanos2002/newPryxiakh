        Thirteen years after his wife went missing in the small town of Bright
        Falls, author Alan Wake is trapped inside a Dark Place that he can’t
        seem to write himself out of. As I sit down to type out this review of
        Alan Wake II, I can somewhat empathize. This is just so incomparable to
        anything else I’ve played in recent memory that it’s tough to work out
        exactly where to start. Alan Wake II is a single-player adventure that
        seamlessly shifts from slow-burn psychological terror to frantic
        survival-horror action, from gorgeously rendered game worlds to striking
        full-motion video sequences, and from morbid investigations to
        show-stopping musical surprises. It’s bloody, it's bonkers, and for the
        most part it's utterly brilliant. Coming in at the tail end of a
        bumper-crop gaming year packed with absolute bangers, Alan Wake II still
        manages to burn as brightly as a freshly fired signal flare.

        Spanning two wildly contrasting realities, Alan Wake II’s roughly
        17-hour story manages to be far more coherent than that of the original
        – despite its substantial increase in complexity. We pick things up in
        present day Bright Falls, taking control of FBI Agent Saga Anderson,
        who’s been dispatched to the small lakeside town to investigate the
        latest victim in a series of ritualistic slaughters: a body found beside
        Cauldron Lake with a gaping hole where his heart used to be. Saga is an
        instantly likable addition to the weird world that Alan Wake shares with
        Remedy Entertainment’s other supernatural game, Control. She’s dedicated
        to her casework but not above a bit of playful banter with her partner,
        Special Agent Alex Casey, and these opening couple of hours of mostly
        combat-free procedural investigation give the story a realistic
        grounding before the darkness starts to descend and every placid
        hillscape transforms into a harrowing hellscape.

        If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive
        innovations to the genre, however, you’re likely to be disappointed in
        that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any
        major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart
        but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more
        customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic
        character classes.

        The first hours of the game gives the story a realistic grounding
      </h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        Part of the reason Alan Wake II’s main serial killer mystery and its
        numerous subplots are so easy to keep track of is due to the caseboard
        found in Saga’s metaphysical ‘mind place’, which can be accessed at any
        moment with the tap of a button. Each new piece of evidence, character
        profile, or foreshadowing manuscript page found in Bright Falls and its
        surroundings must be manually arranged onto a branching tree of red
        string and palm cards pinned to the wall, corralling it all into order
        and keeping you focused on the case. I’m not ashamed to say that I
        couldn’t get through a season of True Detective (at least, one of the
        good ones) without having one eye on my television and the other on a
        Reddit thread open on my phone, so I loved having this in-built method
        of keeping the facts straight.

        As Saga’s investigation progresses in the early moments of Alan Wake
        II’s story, each discovery raises more unsettling questions than it
        answers: Why do so many of the locals behave as though they’ve known
        Saga for years? Why is the janitor character from Control performing
        karaoke in a local town hall? And why did that corpse suddenly haul his
        naked arse out of the morgue and into the woods? Although its difficulty
        level can be adjusted to three different settings, Alan Wake II’s mood
        is always set to uneasy mode.

      <p class="text text5">
        The mystery deepens still when Alan Wake washes up onto the shore of
        Cauldron Lake, rambling about the Dark Place and surprised to learn that
        he’s been missing for the past 13 years. Then Alan Wake II really gets
        weird. From here, the perspective shifts back and forth between Saga’s
        search for the truth in Bright Falls and Alan’s desperate attempts to
        escape his doomed Dark Place dimension, with both sides gradually
        bleeding into each other in increasingly unpredictable and
        discombobulating ways – to the point that I could barely discern fact
        from fiction (within fiction) before eventually resolving into a
        supremely well-executed gut-punch of an ending that neatly ties off the
        bulk of the story threads while tantalizingly leaving a handful of loose
        ones to dangle. Remedy, if you make us wait another 13 years to tie
        these up (and start more) that will be much less endearing.

      <p class="text text6">
        Indeed Alan Wake II features more plots than a cemetery, and just as
        high a bodycount. The fundamentals of combat remain largely the same as
        the enjoyable flashlight-fueled fighting of the original, but its
        execution has been enhanced significantly. Enemies are once again
        literal shadows of their former selves, and the most efficient way to
        dispatch them is by using the boosted beam of your flashlight to burn
        away their cloudy darkness shields and blasting disgusting chunks of
        exposed flesh off their bones with your expanding arsenal of firearms.
        This time around glowing weak points will occasionally be revealed on an
        enemies’ body, and if you manage to successfully target them you can
        inflict substantially more damage and save a few precious ammo rounds in
        the process, which felt like a nice reward for taking an extra fraction
        of a second to carefully line up my shots.
      </p>
      <p class="text text7">
        This won’t be a big deal to anybody used to games that allow you to run,
        but if you’re coming back to Alan Wake along with me it is fantastic:
        Both Saga and Alan are blessed with an unlimited sprint ability, which
        marks a huge improvement to the perennially out-of-puff Alan from the
        original, who couldn’t run 10 yards without doubling over like an
        asthmatic who just took a wrong turn into a smokers lounge.
      </p>
      <p class="text text8">
        Our protagonists are generally more nimble, too; the dodge button feels
        snappier and allowed me to more reliably duck under swinging pipes or
        thrown pickaxes, and it even works on the ground should you be knocked
        off your feet, allowing you to quickly roll out of harm’s way and avoid
        any potential follow-up attacks.

      <p class="text text1">
        Alan’s mental health isn’t the only thing here that isn’t as strong as
        it could be. Although the different arsenals of the two playable
        characters each boast their own advantages, from the heightened stopping
        power and reusable bolts of Saga’s crossbow to the expanded
        area-of-effect of Alan’s flare gun, their individual skill trees seem
        somewhat lopsided in their implementation. Whereas Alan’s ‘Words of
        Power’ skill tree features 21 different skills that can each be
        potentially upgraded up to three times over, Saga’s upgrades are limited
        to just three buffs for each firearm in her inventory, and each comes at
        such a high cost of the collectable manuscript scraps hidden around
        Bright Falls that by the time I’d reached the end credits I’d only
        invested in a handful of them.

      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        Alan Wake II delivers one of the boldest and most brain-bending
        survival-horror storylines this side of Silent Hill 2, presents it with
        uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates
        the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked
        and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers. Even though its
        skill-upgrade systems seem a little superfluous and there were a few
        repeated cliches in Saga’s story that stuck in my craw, I nonetheless
        found both sides of this twisted tale to be endlessly fascinating,
        frequently fear-inducing, and consistently surprising. Alan Wake II is a
        superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem
        like little more than a rough first draft by comparison.
