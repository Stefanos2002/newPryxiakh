      <h1 class="header head1">Insomniac's Best Tale Yet</h1>
      <p class="text text1">
        With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of
        following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and
        heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question
        becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down.
        Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double
        down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted
        another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of
        the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other
        ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each
        other.

        The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun
        as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world
        activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The
        result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably
        thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others.

      <h1 class="header head2">Combat System</h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2’s combat is
        very familiar – it doesn’t have that new suit smell anymore, but it
        still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision
        dodges, the new perfect parries (so you’re not only swerving and
        striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is
        chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The
        movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut
        butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and
        elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies
        are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across
        concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling
        pins – but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be
        broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to
        commit crimes again.

        Overall, there’s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time
        than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the
        stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine,
        this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story
        missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out
        thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to
        get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up
        enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than
        spreading them out to pick them off one by one.

        Once Parker dons the symbiote suit already shown off in trailers, the
        gooey, angry powers that come with it make a big impact, adding more of
        a brawler nature to fights and giving Peter a set of tools to match
        Miles’ satisfying electric abilities. They’re just as enjoyable, as it
        feels like the suit is trying to burst out of the rumbling DualSense
        controller in my hands. This aggressive style of play is rewarded, as
        the only way to heal is by building up your focus bar – filled by
        landing hits and timing perfect dodges – and is another way to make sure
        that exciting rhythm of combat is never lost.

        A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber – which pulls
        enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another – also
        playfully builds into this philosophy.

        The tugboat is as fragile as it looks, meaning it takes only a few
        collisions – even small ones – to send you back to the dock from which
        you most recently set sail. Full disclosure: autosaves are frequent in
        Dredge, conveniently taking place whenever you bring your ship into any
        port. Plus, docks are scattered liberally across the world map, so it
        never feels like a safe haven is too far away to have a fair chance at
        evading danger. It’s great then that dropping anchor at a friendly
        settlement and sleeping through the night can eliminate your panic gauge
        so that you get a fresh start at the beginning of the following day.
        This allows me to fully appreciate moments of tension, since its
        difficulty always feels just balanced enough to provide a challenge and
        a handful of scares without ever crossing a line or feeling unfair.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        Dredge erupted out of the left field as 2023’s most unforgettably creepy
        fishing simulator. Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into
        Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound
        thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its
        fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing – just as
        long as you don’t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent
        story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a
        management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is.
