      <h1 class="header head1">Insomniac's Best Tale Yet</h1>
      <p class="text text1">
        With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of
        following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and
        heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question
        becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down.
        Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double
        down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted
        another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of
        the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other
        ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each
        other.

        The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun
        as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world
        activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The
        result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably
        thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others.

      <h1 class="header head2">Combat System</h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2’s combat is
        very familiar – it doesn’t have that new suit smell anymore, but it
        still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision
        dodges, the new perfect parries (so you’re not only swerving and
        striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is
        chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The
        movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut
        butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and
        elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies
        are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across
        concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling
        pins – but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be
        broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to
        commit crimes again.

        Overall, there’s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time
        than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the
        stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine,
        this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story
        missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out
        thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to
        get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up
        enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than
        spreading them out to pick them off one by one.

        Once Parker dons the symbiote suit already shown off in trailers, the
        gooey, angry powers that come with it make a big impact, adding more of
        a brawler nature to fights and giving Peter a set of tools to match
        Miles’ satisfying electric abilities. They’re just as enjoyable, as it
        feels like the suit is trying to burst out of the rumbling DualSense
        controller in my hands. This aggressive style of play is rewarded, as
        the only way to heal is by building up your focus bar – filled by
        landing hits and timing perfect dodges – and is another way to make sure
        that exciting rhythm of combat is never lost.

        A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber – which pulls
        enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another – also
        playfully builds into this philosophy.

      <h1 class="header head3">Significant improvements to enemy variety</h1>
      <img src="images/spiderman-fight.jpeg" alt="fight_scene" class="img1" />
      <p class="text text6">
        One area that Insomniac has made improvements in is that Spider-Man 2
        offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety, so you’ll no
        longer be battering the same five balaclava bullies with baseball bats.
        New factions and units, such as flamethrower-wielding cultists that keep
        you at a distance, flying drones, and hunters who deploy laser grids
        above your head to limit aerial attacks keep you on your sticky toes.
      </p>
      <p class="text text4">
        Certain enemies are weak to different types of abilities, such as
        electric or symbiote attacks, which also adds an enjoyable extra wrinkle
        to fights. It’s by no means revolutionary stuff, but a welcome added
        level of complexity that makes you consider which powers – or even which
        Spider-Man – are best for a given job. That's not to say there aren’t
        benefits to taking a sneaky route, though, especially when you’re
        playing as Miles and using his invisibility power to quietly take out
        enemies. There are many perch takedown possibilities offered and new
        toys to play with too, such as the Web Line, which allows you to create
        your own highwires over your enemies to prey on them from above.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head3">The Ambience is as great as ever</h1>
      <p class="text text5">
        In keeping with Insomniac’s track record, the music behind it all is
        stellar, with Miles' and Peter's respective signature tunes playing
        depending on who you're controlling. A highlight, though, is the theme
        that follows in Kraven's footsteps, which bears more than a passing
        resemblance to Howard Shore's Uruk-hai war march from The Lord of the
        Rings score. It soundtracks a world that looks stunning, even when
        played in performance mode at a stable 60fps as I did for most of my
        playthrough.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is both
        blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a
        Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to
        life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier
        themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and
        web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them
        comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate
        them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a
        radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been
        made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly
        repetitious side activities.
