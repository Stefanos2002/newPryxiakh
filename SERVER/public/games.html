                  Some of the best films of all time are those whose different
                  strengths all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing
                  whole. The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all
                  excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts
                  complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That
                  is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates

                  Ask yourself this: what do you want from a sequel to The
                  Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? More enemy variety?
                  Better dungeons? Totally unexpected new ideas? Or is simply
                  more Hyrule to explore enough for you? Thankfully, you don’t
                  have to pick just one, because Nintendo’s response to all of
                  those answers is a casual but confident, “Sure thing.” The
                  Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t necessarily

                  I didn’t know I needed a cosmic horror-fueled fishing game in

                  this 12-hour expedition through haunted open waters is both

                  At its core, Insomniac Games’ new adventure strives to make
                  you feel like Spider-Man. And, thankfully, Marvel's Spider-Man
                  on PS4 succeeds at nearly every swing across Manhattan’s
                  rooftops. I was left delighted at nearly every step of its
                  15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that
                  mines the plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great
                  emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is

                  Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live,
                  Diablo 4 is completely awesome to behold even though you know
                  exactly how the song’s going to go from the moment you hear
                  the first iconic note. Diablo 4 doesn’t do much to reinvent
                  ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its series helped
                  pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas it
                  does introduce have forged this latest model into the best
                  Diablo we’ve ever...

                  Thirteen years after his wife went missing in the small town
                  of Bright Falls, author Alan Wake is trapped inside a Dark
                  Place that he can’t seem to write himself out of. As I sit
                  down to type out this review of Alan Wake II, I can somewhat
                  empathize. This is just so incomparable to anything else I’ve
                  played in recent memory that it’s tough to work out exactly
                  where to start. Alan Wake II is a single-player adventure that
                  seamlessly shifts from slow-burn psychological terror to
                  frantic survival-horror action...

                  How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all

                  dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to
                  his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the
                  Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger
                  member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing
                  so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in
