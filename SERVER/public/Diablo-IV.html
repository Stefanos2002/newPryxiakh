        Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live, Diablo 4 is
        completely awesome to behold even though you know exactly how the song’s
        going to go from the moment you hear the first iconic note. Diablo 4
        doesn’t do much to reinvent ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its
        series helped pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas
        it does introduce have forged this latest model into the best Diablo
        we’ve ever had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across
        each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation are all
        among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame activities and
        grind are so well thought out that I struggle to find any fault in them
        – as rare an occurrence as rainfall on Mars. A weak story and some
        irritating bugs do occasionally throw a wet blanket over the fires of
        Hell, but the 80 hours I’ve spent in Sanctuary have still been
        overwhelmingly positive, and even after all that demon slaying and
        obsessing over loot rolls, I’m still very excited to play a whole lot
        more.

        Diablo 4 is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its
        30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths of Hell
        enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers. You’re once again
        sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls where mastering your
        hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your DPS, and improving your
        survivability are generally more important than things like an engaging
        story or explaining the insane diarrhea of flickering lights and
        elemental effects that typically occupy the screen – and practically
        every moment of that is really, really enjoyable whether you’re playing
        alone or with up to three friends.
      </p>
      <p class="text text2">
        If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive
        innovations to the genre, however, you’re likely to be disappointed in
        that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any
        major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart
        but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more
        customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic
        character classes.

        Sanctuary is as great as the music that accompanies it.
      </h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        But before you get any real payoff for what’s expertly set up in the
        first act, you’ll spend the vast majority of the next four going on
        tangentially related errands with more filler than a packing peanut
        factory, before finally getting back to the task at hand. The result is
        an interesting but disjointed story with a payoff that doesn’t quite
        stick the landing. The real shame is that anytime Lilith is on-screen or
        closely involved in whatever action is going on, it’s absolutely
        engrossing stuff. But she’s largely hidden behind a curtain waiting for
        the final act for the vast majority of the campaign, and the diversions
        you’re sent on along the way consistently feel like unnecessary detours.
        Combine that with some seriously disappointing boss fights I won’t
        spoil, especially the campaign’s final one, and it’s hard not to feel
        let down by what this could have been.

        It does help that Diablo 4 looks and sounds fantastic regardless of
        what’s going on in the story. Between the rare but breathtaking CGI
        cutscenes and the more numerous in-engine cutscenes that happen in
        between major story missions, as well as the detailed, disgustingly
        corrupted environments found in dungeons and out in the world, Sanctuary
        is rarely not a gorgeous sight to behold. It’s no small feat, then, that
        Diablo 4 sounds even better than it looks, with one of the most
        memorable OSTs in recent memory, mostly great voice acting, and lots of
        gross demon roars and shrieks as you lay waste to the minions of Hell.

      <h1 class="header head4">Buildcrafting feels Unique</h1>
      <p class="text text5">
        Part of what helps make each option feel unique are the class mechanics
        that unlock at various points in the campaign. For example, the
        Sorceress gains access to the enchantment system in Act I, which allows
        you to enchant a couple of their spells to augment how they work. I used
        one of my enchantments on my teleport spell to turn the standard dodge
        every class gets into a second teleport cooldown, greatly improving my
        mobility. Each class has their own unique twist, whether it’s augmenting
        your ranks of the dead as a necromancer or bonding with spirit animals
        to gain beastly enhancements as a druid, and that goes a long way to
        making your playthrough and buildcrafting on each character feel
        distinct in some really cool ways.

      <p class="text text6">
        Gear can also substantially affect the paths you might choose to take a
        character down. For example, after completing a job for a demented tree,
        you could be rewarded with a magical pair of pants that heals you over
        time when standing close to enemies, warranting a shift in your build
        from slaying enemies from afar to something close quarters.
      </p>

      <p class="text text7">
        Trying out new builds and experimenting with powerful new pieces of
        equipment is one of the best parts of Diablo 4, and I spent most of my
        time on my sorcerer, where I continuously discovered new and extremely
        rude ways to be the best glass cannon I could be, like equipping an ice
        shield that froze enemies for the sin of attacking me to remove said
        shield. The variety of systems available to optimize your character are
        so numerous that it can be pretty dizzying at first, even for a Diablo
        veteran like me, but when properly mastered this is easily one of the
        best buildcrafting toolboxes of all time.
      </p>
      <p class="text text8">
        Whether it’s the dense skill trees, the endgame paragon boards and
        powerful glyphs that can be upgraded and socketed into them, the
        plethora of loot options across various world tiers and rarity levels,
        the gems and vendor upgrades you can use to make that equipment even
        better, or the fact that gear perks can be tweaked to optimize them for
        a certain build, Blizzard seems to have thought of just about
        everything.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head3">Take your time in the dungeons</h1>
      <p class="text text1">
        Running through murky halls with my decked out murder machines feels
        significantly more streamlined since the dungeon tweaking Blizzard
        rolled out in response to feedback from the beta weekends, with far less
        backtracking and wasted time. That keeps things moving along at a great
        pace and makes diving into the bone-riddled halls of an ancient tomb or
        what I can only assume is a demon body parts exhibit a consistent joy.
        No matter what class you’ve chosen, shredding your way through piles of
        wretched reprobates is usually effortless fun that lets you flex your
        unrivaled power, though some of the more difficult activities like
        Nightmare Dungeons are bound to put those skills to the test.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        Diablo 4 is a stunning sequel with near perfect endgame and progression
        design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down. The story is a
        pretty big disappointment despite still being a noticeable improvement
        over Diablo 3 and there are some annoying bugs that need squashing, but
        the combat, the loot game, and both the sights and sounds of this world
        are impressive enough to smooth over those rough edges. Diablo 4 takes
        the strategy of refining things the series already did so well rather
        than giving it a more substantial overhaul, and that careful and
        reverent path has shaped this massive sequel into one of the most
        polished ARPGs ever created, which makes slicing through the legions of
        the damned a hell of a good time.
