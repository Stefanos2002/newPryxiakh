        Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live, Diablo 4 is
        completely awesome to behold even though you know exactly how the song’s
        going to go from the moment you hear the first iconic note. Diablo 4
        doesn’t do much to reinvent ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its
        series helped pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas
        it does introduce have forged this latest model into the best Diablo
        we’ve ever had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across
        each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation are all
        among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame activities and
        grind are so well thought out that I struggle to find any fault in them
        – as rare an occurrence as rainfall on Mars. A weak story and some
        irritating bugs do occasionally throw a wet blanket over the fires of
        Hell, but the 80 hours I’ve spent in Sanctuary have still been
        overwhelmingly positive, and even after all that demon slaying and
        obsessing over loot rolls, I’m still very excited to play a whole lot
        more.

        Diablo 4 is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its
        30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths of Hell
        enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers. You’re once again
        sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls where mastering your
        hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your DPS, and improving your
        survivability are generally more important than things like an engaging
        story or explaining the insane diarrhea of flickering lights and
        elemental effects that typically occupy the screen – and practically
        every moment of that is really, really enjoyable whether you’re playing
        alone or with up to three friends.
      </p>
      <p class="text text2">
        If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive
        innovations to the genre, however, you’re likely to be disappointed in
        that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any
        major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart
        but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more
        customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic
        character classes.

        Sanctuary is as great as the music that accompanies it.
      </h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        But before you get any real payoff for what’s expertly set up in the
        first act, you’ll spend the vast majority of the next four going on
        tangentially related errands with more filler than a packing peanut
        factory, before finally getting back to the task at hand. The result is
        an interesting but disjointed story with a payoff that doesn’t quite
        stick the landing. The real shame is that anytime Lilith is on-screen or
        closely involved in whatever action is going on, it’s absolutely
        engrossing stuff. But she’s largely hidden behind a curtain waiting for
        the final act for the vast majority of the campaign, and the diversions
        you’re sent on along the way consistently feel like unnecessary detours.
        Combine that with some seriously disappointing boss fights I won’t
        spoil, especially the campaign’s final one, and it’s hard not to feel
        let down by what this could have been.

        It does help that Diablo 4 looks and sounds fantastic regardless of
        what’s going on in the story. Between the rare but breathtaking CGI
        cutscenes and the more numerous in-engine cutscenes that happen in
        between major story missions, as well as the detailed, disgustingly
        corrupted environments found in dungeons and out in the world, Sanctuary
        is rarely not a gorgeous sight to behold. It’s no small feat, then, that
        Diablo 4 sounds even better than it looks, with one of the most
        memorable OSTs in recent memory, mostly great voice acting, and lots of
        gross demon roars and shrieks as you lay waste to the minions of Hell.

      <h1 class="header head4">Buildcrafting feels Unique</h1>
      <p class="text text5">
        Part of what helps make each option feel unique are the class mechanics
        that unlock at various points in the campaign. For example, the
        Sorceress gains access to the enchantment system in Act I, which allows
        you to enchant a couple of their spells to augment how they work. I used
        one of my enchantments on my teleport spell to turn the standard dodge
        every class gets into a second teleport cooldown, greatly improving my
        mobility. Each class has their own unique twist, whether it’s augmenting
        your ranks of the dead as a necromancer or bonding with spirit animals
        to gain beastly enhancements as a druid, and that goes a long way to
        making your playthrough and buildcrafting on each character feel
        distinct in some really cool ways.

      <h1 class="header head3">The Art Of War</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        And there are battles aplenty. Though Kratos only kills for survival
        now, he still does so with a flair for brutality. The stun-kill
        animations can be especially gory and literally bone-crunching affairs.
        (Though, because there’s only one per enemy type, they become somewhat
        repetitive to watch.) While God of War is altogether more emotionally
        complex and layered, its excellent combat undoubtedly carries forward
        the blood-soaked traditions of the series. Kratos’ signature weapon this
        time out is the Leviathan Axe, which is one of the best weapons I’ve
        used in any recent game. It begins with a simple light and heavy attack
        but can be upgraded and given new abilities throughout your journey.
        It’s a lot of fun to chop and slice through hordes of foes with, but
        I’ve rarely enjoyed a weapon more than when the axe is flying through
        the air.

      <p class="small-head">~A Whole New Terrain~</p>
      <p class="text text7">
        God of War’s initially linear world opens up a bit after the first few
        hours, and it encourages exploration through its many rewards and
        collectibles for completing optional puzzles and fights. But you can
        occasionally stumble into the path of a much more difficult opponent,
        clearly denoted by the purple color of their health bar, and they can
        often take you down in one or two hits. If I felt hungry for a
        challenge, God of War never let me down.
      </p>
      <p class="text text8">
        There’s plenty of freedom, although the map never becomes truly “open
        world” in the way that games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
        Wild or Horizon Zero Dawn are; instead, it’s an interconnected series of
        diverse locations, many of which are gated behind certain story moments
        and collectible milestones until the very end.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily.
        But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect
        of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a
        masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note
        character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled
        both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son;
        one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both
        gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each
        accomplishment.
