      <p class="text text1">
        I didn’t know I needed a cosmic horror-fueled fishing game in my life –
        at least, not until I played Dredge. It’s not exactly a full-blown
        management sim ala Fishing Planet, but this 12-hour expedition through
        haunted open waters is both mysterious and compelling enough to tickle
        my brain and tug on all the right heartstrings. I felt possessed into
        flinging myself overboard with an unhinged smile cast across my lips,
        like one of its many macabre characters. …Figuratively speaking.
        Starting small and slow is a challenge, but upgrading my fishing boat
        led Dredge to spout forth a flurry of meaningful improvements to my
        fishing speed, inventory capacity, and my ability to scope out and evade
        the plethora of dangers that might rear their ugly heads at night.

        All I know is that I’m a contract fisherman who’s rescued by the
        townsfolk of a remote island settlement called Greater Marrow. I’m given
        a new boat and… that’s all. But due to Dredge’s simple fishing and
        movement mechanics, this is pretty much all I need to know before I can
        begin my quest for fish on the open ocean, and it’s there that I’m
        immediately treated to a gorgeous sunrise stretching over the horizon.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head2">It's all about control</h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        Controlling your boat through tight spaces and navigating harsh waters
        is a breeze since moving forward and backward (and braking) is as simple
        as moving the left thumbstick back and forth. It’s an enjoyable added
        touch that progressing through each step of the main quest unlocks
        additional movement abilities, like the Haste skill that gives a speed
        boost that’s especially useful when getting out of the way of a hungry
        sea monster – but comes with the risk of destroying an engine and
        damaging your hull if you don’t give it intermittent rests.
      </p>

      <h1 class="header head3">Dark means danger</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        Dredge’s story is intentionally cryptic at first glance, with your
        ship’s bow providing minimal context to the series of events unraveling
        in front of your eyes. But what starts out as a relaxing fishing trip
        rapidly takes a darker turn through threatening encounters with the
        ocean’s natural and supernatural denizens – who turn hostile after dark.
      </p>
      <p class="text text7">
        When the fog rolls in, your panic meter begins to increase, so the
        higher it goes, the more likely it is that monsters and other obstacles
        will spawn. This means that you have to balance that against turning on
        lights to temporarily lower panic. Of course, light attracts monsters
        that will quickly destroy your boat’s hull if you don’t evade them, so
        it’s a bit more challenging to manage than a simple fishing game. That
        brings balance and danger to every expedition.
      </p>

      <p class="text text8">
        Adding even more challenge, the world shifts around at night, meaning I
        sometimes ended up running headfirst into a rock that definitely wasn’t
        there during the daytime. For this reason, it’s never a great idea to
        make a beeline for the nearest port of call when panic sets in. At
        least, not without making sure the next few feet in front of you are
        clear, which is made easier by upgrading your boat with bigger, brighter
        lights. This interaction between systems gives Dredge a layer of
        strategy that keeps things interesting even when I’m not making
        substantial progress on the main quest.

      <h1 class="header head3">Be carefull where you land</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        The tugboat is as fragile as it looks, meaning it takes only a few
        collisions – even small ones – to send you back to the dock from which
        you most recently set sail. Full disclosure: autosaves are frequent in
        Dredge, conveniently taking place whenever you bring your ship into any
        port. Plus, docks are scattered liberally across the world map, so it
        never feels like a safe haven is too far away to have a fair chance at
        evading danger. It’s great then that dropping anchor at a friendly
        settlement and sleeping through the night can eliminate your panic gauge
        so that you get a fresh start at the beginning of the following day.
        This allows me to fully appreciate moments of tension, since its
        difficulty always feels just balanced enough to provide a challenge and
        a handful of scares without ever crossing a line or feeling unfair.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        Dredge erupted out of the left field as 2023’s most unforgettably creepy
        fishing simulator. Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into
        Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound
        thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its
        fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing – just as
        long as you don’t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent
        story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a
        management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is.
