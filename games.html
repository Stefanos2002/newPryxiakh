                  Some of the best films of all time are those whose different
                  strengths all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing
                  whole. The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all
                  excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts
                  complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That
                  is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates
                  story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action...
                  <!-- gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward
                you with a deeper understanding of its characters and its
                expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful
                composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its
                design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways
                in both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse
                mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but
                thoughtfully reimagined character, God of War’s
                fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions.
                It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never cuts
                away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos’
                relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also
                encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world
                consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying
                combat. -->

                  Ask yourself this: what do you want from a sequel to The
                  Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? More enemy variety?
                  Better dungeons? Totally unexpected new ideas? Or is simply
                  more Hyrule to explore enough for you? Thankfully, you don’t
                  have to pick just one, because Nintendo’s response to all of
                  those answers is a casual but confident, “Sure thing.” The
                  Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t necessarily
                  revolutionize what...
                  <!--already
                made Breath of the Wild one of the greatest games of all time,
                but it’s not a sequel that’s simply more of the same, either.
                This sandbox is bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious,
                with creative new systems like vehicle building, ridiculous
                weapon crafting, and a revamped Hyrule map with a dizzying
                amount of depth further fleshing out the intoxicating
                exploration that made the original so captivating. Breath of the
                Wild felt far from unfinished but, inconceivably, Tears of the
                Kingdom has somehow made it feel like a first draft. Before we
                dive too deep into Hyrule, a quick note about spoilers. I won’t
                spoil the (actually pretty great) story Tears tells, but these
                games are about so much more than the plot. That magic the first
                time you see one of BotW’s dragons soaring overhead is around
                every corner here too, and the last thing I’d want to do is
                steal the many moments that made my jaw literally drop from you.
                That said, there are some huge parts of Tears that are
                introduced fairly early on that I will be talking about because
                of how fundamental they are to why this game is so impressive. I
                am going to preserve as much of the magic as I can but, if (like
                millions of others) you’ve already decided you are going to play
                Tears, you should probably just go play it and then come back to
                share in the wonder with me later. -->

                  I didn’t know I needed a cosmic horror-fueled fishing game in
                  my life – at least, not until I played Dredge. It’s not
                  exactly a full-blown management sim ala Fishing Planet, but
                  this 12-hour expedition through haunted open waters is both
                  mysterious and compelling enough to tickle my brain and tug on
                  all the right heartstrings. I felt possessed into flinging
                  myself overboard with an unhinged smile cast across my lips
                  like one of its...
                  <!-- many
                macabre characters. …Figuratively speaking. Starting small and
                slow is a challenge, but upgrading my fishing boat led Dredge to
                spout forth a flurry of meaningful improvements to my fishing
                speed, inventory capacity, and my ability to scope out and evade
                the plethora of dangers that might rear their ugly heads at
                night. Managing this fishing boat is no plank walk; five unique
                zones fit cozily within its relatively compact open world,
                hiding enough secrets, quests, and unique varieties of
                cartilaginous fish to fill its duration without overstaying its
                welcome. -->

                  At its core, Insomniac Games’ new adventure strives to make
                  you feel like Spider-Man. And, thankfully, Marvel's Spider-Man
                  on PS4 succeeds at nearly every swing across Manhattan’s
                  rooftops. I was left delighted at nearly every step of its
                  15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that
                  mines the plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great
                  emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is
                  an excellent...
                  <!-- set of webswinging mechanics, which -- combined with fun gadgets
                and plenty of puns -- makes for thrilling action in both the
                massive setpieces and in the quiet, confined corridors of tense
                sequences. Insomniac’s first foray into the realm of Marvel
                superheroes is a continually exciting adventure whose open world
                and combat are only occasionally caught up in a web of overly
                familiar trappings. -->

                  Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live,
                  Diablo 4 is completely awesome to behold even though you know
                  exactly how the song’s going to go from the moment you hear
                  the first iconic note. Diablo 4 doesn’t do much to reinvent
                  ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its series helped
                  pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas it
                  does introduce have forged this latest model into the best
                  Diablo we’ve ever...
                  <!-- had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across
                each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation
                are all among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame
                activities and grind are so well thought out that I struggle to
                find any fault in them – as rare an occurrence as rainfall on
                Mars. A weak story and some irritating bugs do occasionally
                throw a wet blanket over the fires of Hell, but the 80 hours
                I’ve spent in Sanctuary have still been overwhelmingly positive,
                and even after all that demon slaying and obsessing over loot
                rolls, I’m still very excited to play a whole lot more. Diablo 4
                is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its
                30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths
                of Hell enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers.
                You’re once again sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls
                where mastering your hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your
                DPS, and improving your survivability are generally more
                important than things like an engaging story or explaining the
                insane diarrhea of flickering lights and elemental effects that
                typically occupy the screen – and practically every moment of
                that is really, really enjoyable whether you’re playing alone or
                with up to three friends. Running dungeons captures that
                familiar but just as compelling loop of killing hordes of
                enemies, completing objectives, and downing bosses, and running
                sidequests to learn more about the world’s lore and characters
                is usually a very good time even while the main plot meanders. -->
