          Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths
          all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The
          Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of
          films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other to
          form a fantastic work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War –
          its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into
          fantastic action... gameplay, which facilitates exploration and
          puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters
          and its expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful
          composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its
          design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in
          both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse mythology-inspired
          world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined character,
          God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of
          emotions. It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never
          cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos’
          relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also
          encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world
          consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.

          God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot.
          Kratos and Atreus – who start as, at best, acquaintances – begin their
          journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus
          bonded with much more than his father. The two set out to the tallest
          point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.The setup is
          Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak in the distance and
          knew I’d get there eventually – but as similar stories have taught me,
          the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles, both
          natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth
          of terrifying threats, beginning with the first major encounter in the
          opening hours.

          The game describes two people with demonstrably different
          personalities, one of them young and still innocent, the other old and
          as blood-soaked as they come, both grieving over the same woman in
          different ways. Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems
          disappointed in his lack of skill and stomach for combat, referring to
          him mostly as “Boy,” and rarely making eye or physical contact with
          him. (He will, of course, unflinchingly beat the life out of anyone
          who threatens his son, which appears to be the only way he knows how
          to express affection.) Kratos’ uncertainty of how to relate to a boy
          he’s both looking to turn into a survivor and yet afraid may turn out
          like him is devastating to watch.
