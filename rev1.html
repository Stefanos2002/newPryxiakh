      <p class="text text1">
        Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths
        all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining,
        The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up
        of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic
        work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score
        elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action...
        gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with
        a deeper understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful
        world.

        God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts,
        deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in
        unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse
        mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully
        reimagined character, God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a
        nonstop whirlwind of emotions. It’s all framed by one continuous camera
        shot that never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all:
        Kratos’ relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also
        encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world consistently
        rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.

      <h1 class="header head2">Simple and Straightforward</h1>
      <p class="text text2">
        God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot.
        Kratos and Atreus – who start as, at best, acquaintances – begin their
        journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus
        bonded with much more than his father. The two set out to the tallest
        point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.The setup is
        Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak in the distance and
        knew I’d get there eventually – but as similar stories have taught me,
        the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles, both
        natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth of
        terrifying threats, beginning with the first major encounter in the
        opening hours.
      </p>
      <p class="text text3">
        The game describes two people with demonstrably different personalities,
        one of them young and still innocent, the other old and as blood-soaked
        as they come, both grieving over the same woman in different ways.
        Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems disappointed in his
        lack of skill and stomach for combat, referring to him mostly as “Boy,”
        and rarely making eye or physical contact with him. Kratos’ uncertainty
        of how to relate to a boy he’s both looking to turn into a survivor and
        yet afraid may turn out like him is devastating to watch.

        Their dichotomy plays out in stirring, realistic moments throughout the
        story. I was surprised by how often I saw myself in both Kratos and
        Atreus’ well-worn shoes. I’ve told important people in my own life some
        of the very things they say to each other, and I’ve thought (but been
        too afraid to speak aloud) many others, making God of War’s
        relationships feel real and cuttingly honest. Other games have tackled
        parent-child relationships, but I can’t remember a father-son dynamic so
        successfully developed and used to ground a fantastical adventure.
      </p>
      <p class="text text5">
        This depth and complexity is something entirely new to Kratos, and this
        new God of War transforms him from the previous games’ flat embodiment
        of the bloodthirsty warrior cliche into someone who can stand shoulder
        to shoulder with some of my favorite protagonists in recent media. He’s
        now voiced by Stargate SG-1’s thunderous baritone Christopher Judge, who
        can say so much with a single word or grunt. He gives the long-running
        character’s stoic dialogue both an intimidating gravitas and nuance you
        can hear as he grapples with the needs of his son, his internal fears
        and pain and, of course, the elements and monsters trying to stop him
        from reaching his goal.

        And there are battles aplenty. Though Kratos only kills for survival
        now, he still does so with a flair for brutality. The stun-kill
        animations can be especially gory and literally bone-crunching affairs.
        (Though, because there’s only one per enemy type, they become somewhat
        repetitive to watch.) While God of War is altogether more emotionally
        complex and layered, its excellent combat undoubtedly carries forward
        the blood-soaked traditions of the series. Kratos’ signature weapon this
        time out is the Leviathan Axe, which is one of the best weapons I’ve
        used in any recent game. It begins with a simple light and heavy attack
        but can be upgraded and given new abilities throughout your journey.
        It’s a lot of fun to chop and slice through hordes of foes with, but
        I’ve rarely enjoyed a weapon more than when the axe is flying through
        the air.

      <p class="text text7">
        God of War’s initially linear world opens up a bit after the first few
        hours, and it encourages exploration through its many rewards and
        collectibles for completing optional puzzles and fights. But you can
        occasionally stumble into the path of a much more difficult opponent,
        clearly denoted by the purple color of their health bar, and they can
        often take you down in one or two hits. If I felt hungry for a
        challenge, God of War never let me down.
      </p>
      <p class="text text8">
        There’s plenty of freedom, although the map never becomes truly “open
        world” in the way that games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
        Wild or Horizon Zero Dawn are; instead, it’s an interconnected series of
        diverse locations, many of which are gated behind certain story moments
        and collectible milestones until the very end.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily.
        But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect
        of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a
        masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note
        character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled
        both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son;
        one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both
        gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each
        accomplishment.
