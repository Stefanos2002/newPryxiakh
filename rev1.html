          Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths
          all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The
          Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of
          films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other to
          form a fantastic work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War –
          its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into
          fantastic action... gameplay, which facilitates exploration and
          puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters
          and its expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful
          composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its
          design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in
          both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse mythology-inspired
          world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined character,
          God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of
          emotions. It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never
          cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos’
          relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also
          encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world
          consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.
