        Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths
        all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining,
        The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up
        of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic
        work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score
        elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action...
        gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with
        a deeper understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful
        world. God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking
        parts, deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in
        unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story. Set in a new, Norse
        mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully
        reimagined character, God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a
        nonstop whirlwind of emotions. It’s all framed by one continuous camera
        shot that never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all:
        Kratos’ relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also
        encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world consistently
        rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.

        God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot.
        Kratos and Atreus – who start as, at best, acquaintances – begin their
        journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus
        bonded with much more than his father. The two set out to the tallest
        point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.The setup is
        Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak in the distance and
        knew I’d get there eventually – but as similar stories have taught me,
        the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles, both
        natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth of
        terrifying threats, beginning with the first major encounter in the
        opening hours.
