          Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
          by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
          Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy
          #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been
          featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels,
          and plays. Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker, a
          teenage high school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and
          Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker
          died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the
          struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many
          supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and
          Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the
          Black Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and
          Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman
          spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive
          spider; these include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina,
          durability, coordination, and balance, clinging to surfaces and
          ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger with his precognition
          ability called "spider-sense". He also builds wrist-mounted
          "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own
          design, which are used both for fighting and for web-swinging across
          the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for his own personal
          gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter did not
          stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming the
          superhero known as Spider-Man. When Spider-Man first appeared in the
          early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated
          to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man comic
          series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student
          from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose
          "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were
          issues to which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man had
          all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as
          Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain
          America and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself that "with
          great power comes great responsibility" — a line included in a text
          box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story but
          later retroactively attributed to the late Uncle Ben Parker. Marvel
          has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and
          longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years,
          the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City
          high school student to a troubled but outgoing college student, to a
          married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance
          photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus also
          took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a
          body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has also
          published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man,
          including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel
          O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which
          features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate
          universe; and then Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which depicts a
          teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man
          after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a
          superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity,
          where he sometimes works alongside Peter. Spider-Man is one of the
          most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] He has
          appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV
          series including the first original animated series Spider-Man with
          Paul Soles voicing Spider-Man, a live-action television series,
          syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films.
          Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in
          Spidey Super Stories, a recurring skit on The Electric Company from
          1974 to 1977.[11] In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed
          by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, by Andrew
          Garfield in two films directed by Marc Webb,[12] and in the Marvel
          Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve Carney starred originally as
          Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the
          Dark.[13] Spider-Man was also been voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris
          Pine in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
          Spider-Man has been well-received as a superhero and comic book
          character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular and
          iconic comic book superheroes of all time and one of the most popular
          characters in all fiction.
