      <h1 class="header head1">Insomniac's Best Tale</h1>
      <p class="text text1">
        With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of
        following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and
        heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question
        becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down.
        Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double
        down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted
        another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of
        the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other
        ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each
        other.

        The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun
        as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world
        activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The
        result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably
        thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others.

      <h1 class="header head2">It's all about control</h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        Controlling your boat through tight spaces and navigating harsh waters
        is a breeze since moving forward and backward (and braking) is as simple
        as moving the left thumbstick back and forth. It’s an enjoyable added
        touch that progressing through each step of the main quest unlocks
        additional movement abilities, like the Haste skill that gives a speed
        boost that’s especially useful when getting out of the way of a hungry
        sea monster – but comes with the risk of destroying an engine and
        damaging your hull if you don’t give it intermittent rests.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head3">Dark means danger</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        Dredge’s story is intentionally cryptic at first glance, with your
        ship’s bow providing minimal context to the series of events unraveling
        in front of your eyes. But what starts out as a relaxing fishing trip
        rapidly takes a darker turn through threatening encounters with the
        ocean’s natural and supernatural denizens – who turn hostile after dark.
      </p>
      <p class="text text7">
        When the fog rolls in, your panic meter begins to increase, so the
        higher it goes, the more likely it is that monsters and other obstacles
        will spawn. This means that you have to balance that against turning on
        lights to temporarily lower panic. Of course, light attracts monsters
        that will quickly destroy your boat’s hull if you don’t evade them, so
        it’s a bit more challenging to manage than a simple fishing game. That
        brings balance and danger to every expedition.

      <p class="text text8">
        Adding even more challenge, the world shifts around at night, meaning I
        sometimes ended up running headfirst into a rock that definitely wasn’t
        there during the daytime. For this reason, it’s never a great idea to
        make a beeline for the nearest port of call when panic sets in. At
        least, not without making sure the next few feet in front of you are
        clear, which is made easier by upgrading your boat with bigger, brighter
        lights. This interaction between systems gives Dredge a layer of
        strategy that keeps things interesting even when I’m not making
        substantial progress on the main quest.

      <h1 class="header head3">Be carefull where you land</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        The tugboat is as fragile as it looks, meaning it takes only a few
        collisions – even small ones – to send you back to the dock from which
        you most recently set sail. Full disclosure: autosaves are frequent in
        Dredge, conveniently taking place whenever you bring your ship into any
        port. Plus, docks are scattered liberally across the world map, so it
        never feels like a safe haven is too far away to have a fair chance at
        evading danger. It’s great then that dropping anchor at a friendly
        settlement and sleeping through the night can eliminate your panic gauge
        so that you get a fresh start at the beginning of the following day.
        This allows me to fully appreciate moments of tension, since its
        difficulty always feels just balanced enough to provide a challenge and
        a handful of scares without ever crossing a line or feeling unfair.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        Dredge erupted out of the left field as 2023’s most unforgettably creepy
        fishing simulator. Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into
        Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound
        thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its
        fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing – just as
        long as you don’t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent
        story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a
        management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is.
