        Many of us have grown up with "Zelda" and "Super Mario" games. They are
        the two biggest franchises of Nintendo and for some reason even today
        they manage to keep our interest undiminished. The Legend of Zelda:
        Breath of the Wild is of course a slightly different title than the
        rest, but it manages and maintains the same magic that Ocarina of Time
        had back then.
      </p>
      <p class="text textplus">
        Obviously, the first thing to mention about Breath of the Wild is its
        new open world. The tremendous freedom and sense of adventure that we
        feel, from the very first minutes, is the greatest achievement of the
        game. Facing the world of Hyrule for the first time you will see a
        magical landscape in front of you, while you will notice certain places
        on the map that you will immediately want to explore, such as temples,
        cities, enemy camps and ruins.

        It's important to understand that Nintendo didn't fall into the trap of
        creating landscapes that could exist on Earth. Everything seems to be
        neatly in place. That's why you'll see huge mountains and valleys, and
        even quite a few crumbling ruins. Almost every type of possible climate
        and environment will have a representation and it is properly placed to
        provide us with a wide variety. Also, the world is filled with dozens of
        things to do on your way, which will often disorient you, almost to the
        point where you forget where you were supposed to go and what you were
        supposed to do.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head2">Cooking and ingredients</h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        The truth is that our survival through some crafting system is not an
        unusual phenomenon in adventure titles, but it is usually done in a very
        rough way. In Breath of the Wild we rely on the materials we collect
        from the environment, such as fruit and meat from animals, to cook or
        eat directly. The system is relatively very simple and does not need
        much explanation from NPCs, we just take the ingredients and throw them
        into a boiling cauldron (there is usually one in villages), and if the
        combination of ingredients is right, then we will have a delicious food.
        When we create a new food, we automatically "learn" the recipe so we can
        know how we created it. Of course, if you want you can consume some of
        the materials as well, but they will heal you very few hearts and many
        times it is not worth wasting them like that.
      </p>

      <p class="text text4">
        The foods we cook can help us on our journey in ways other than Heal.
        For example, if you add some hot peppers to your recipe, it will also
        give you a buff for a few minutes which helps you withstand the cold.
        Which is quite useful in snowy areas where you literally die... of the
        cold. In general, you will notice that all the recipes are neat and to
        some extent they are also quite realistic, that is, the result they will
        have on us will make sense.

        This depth and complexity is something entirely new to Kratos, and this
        new God of War transforms him from the previous games’ flat embodiment
        of the bloodthirsty warrior cliche into someone who can stand shoulder
        to shoulder with some of my favorite protagonists in recent media. He’s
        now voiced by Stargate SG-1’s thunderous baritone Christopher Judge, who
        can say so much with a single word or grunt. He gives the long-running
        character’s stoic dialogue both an intimidating gravitas and nuance you
        can hear as he grapples with the needs of his son, his internal fears
        and pain and, of course, the elements and monsters trying to stop him
        from reaching his goal.

      <h1 class="header head3">The Art Of War</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        And there are battles aplenty. Though Kratos only kills for survival
        now, he still does so with a flair for brutality. The stun-kill
        animations can be especially gory and literally bone-crunching affairs.
        (Though, because there’s only one per enemy type, they become somewhat
        repetitive to watch.) While God of War is altogether more emotionally
        complex and layered, its excellent combat undoubtedly carries forward
        the blood-soaked traditions of the series. Kratos’ signature weapon this
        time out is the Leviathan Axe, which is one of the best weapons I’ve
        used in any recent game. It begins with a simple light and heavy attack
        but can be upgraded and given new abilities throughout your journey.
        It’s a lot of fun to chop and slice through hordes of foes with, but
        I’ve rarely enjoyed a weapon more than when the axe is flying through
        the air.

      <p class="text text7">
        God of War’s initially linear world opens up a bit after the first few
        hours, and it encourages exploration through its many rewards and
        collectibles for completing optional puzzles and fights. But you can
        occasionally stumble into the path of a much more difficult opponent,
        clearly denoted by the purple color of their health bar, and they can
        often take you down in one or two hits. If I felt hungry for a
        challenge, God of War never let me down.
      </p>
      <p class="text text8">
        There’s plenty of freedom, although the map never becomes truly “open
        world” in the way that games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
        Wild or Horizon Zero Dawn are; instead, it’s an interconnected series of
        diverse locations, many of which are gated behind certain story moments
        and collectible milestones until the very end.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head-final">Verdict</h1>
      <p class="text text9">
        I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily.
        But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect
        of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a
        masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note
        character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled
        both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son;
        one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both
        gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each
        accomplishment.
