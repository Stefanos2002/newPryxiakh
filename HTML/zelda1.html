        Many of us have grown up with "Zelda" and "Super Mario" games. They are
        the two biggest franchises of Nintendo and for some reason even today
        they manage to keep our interest undiminished. The Legend of Zelda:
        Breath of the Wild is of course a slightly different title than the
        rest, but it manages and maintains the same magic that Ocarina of Time
        had back then.
      </p>
      <p class="text textplus">
        Obviously, the first thing to mention about Breath of the Wild is its
        new open world. The tremendous freedom and sense of adventure that we
        feel, from the very first minutes, is the greatest achievement of the
        game. Facing the world of Hyrule for the first time you will see a
        magical landscape in front of you, while you will notice certain places
        on the map that you will immediately want to explore, such as temples,
        cities, enemy camps and ruins.

        It's important to understand that Nintendo didn't fall into the trap of
        creating landscapes that could exist on Earth. Everything seems to be
        neatly in place. That's why you'll see huge mountains and valleys, and
        even quite a few crumbling ruins. Almost every type of possible climate
        and environment will have a representation and it is properly placed to
        provide us with a wide variety. Also, the world is filled with dozens of
        things to do on your way, which will often disorient you, almost to the
        point where you forget where you were supposed to go and what you were
        supposed to do.
      </p>
      <h1 class="header head2">Cooking and ingredients</h1>
      <p class="text text3">
        The truth is that our survival through some crafting system is not an
        unusual phenomenon in adventure titles, but it is usually done in a very
        rough way. In Breath of the Wild we rely on the materials we collect
        from the environment, such as fruit and meat from animals, to cook or
        eat directly. The system is relatively very simple and does not need
        much explanation from NPCs, we just take the ingredients and throw them
        into a boiling cauldron (there is usually one in villages), and if the
        combination of ingredients is right, then we will have a delicious food.
        When we create a new food, we automatically "learn" the recipe so we can
        know how we created it. Of course, if you want you can consume some of
        the materials as well, but they will heal you very few hearts and many
        times it is not worth wasting them like that.
      </p>

      <p class="text text4">
        The foods we cook can help us on our journey in ways other than Heal.
        For example, if you add some hot peppers to your recipe, it will also
        give you a buff for a few minutes which helps you withstand the cold.
        Which is quite useful in snowy areas where you literally die... of the
        cold. In general, you will notice that all the recipes are neat and to
        some extent they are also quite realistic, that is, the result they will
        have on us will make sense.

        This depth and complexity is something entirely new to Kratos, and this
        new God of War transforms him from the previous games’ flat embodiment
        of the bloodthirsty warrior cliche into someone who can stand shoulder
        to shoulder with some of my favorite protagonists in recent media. He’s
        now voiced by Stargate SG-1’s thunderous baritone Christopher Judge, who
        can say so much with a single word or grunt. He gives the long-running
        character’s stoic dialogue both an intimidating gravitas and nuance you
        can hear as he grapples with the needs of his son, his internal fears
        and pain and, of course, the elements and monsters trying to stop him
        from reaching his goal.

      <h1 class="header head3">Battle System</h1>
      <p class="text text6">
        The combat system of Breath of the Wild is quite simple, but it also has
        a degree of difficulty as the game progresses. In the beginning, you
        should collect all the items from the opponents, because as you fight,
        your items will break and even with just 4-5 simple hits. Of course,
        when the object goes to break your next hit will always be critical, so
        you might even be able to kill your opponent. But in addition to the
        basic hits, you will be able to use shields that will also break with
        use, and if you make a successful parry you will have the opportunity to
        counter hit with an impressive slow motion. Don't hesitate to pick up
        some pieces from your opponents that break during the battle to finish
        them off with, like for example their... hands!
      </p>
      <!-- <p class="small-head">~A Whole New Terrain~</p> -->
      <p class="text text7">
        Of course, we can also throw our weapons to kill an enemy when he
        escapes, but the long range combat doesn't stop there. Archery also
        plays a very important role in the game. With the press of a button Link
        whips out his bow and if possible can take out large opponents without
        even getting close to him. The game even has a variety of arrows that
        can either create an explosion or burn someone alive. As in several
        other games, here too if we hit someone in the head we will do a
        "headshot" that will cause a lot of damage, while sometimes killing
        instantly. Of course, all this happens the first time we play, because
        as we progress the enemies become more and more powerful.
      </p>

      <p class="text text8">
        But all this happens mainly to the monsters we meet outside on the
        street. When we meet a boss things are quite different. Bosses usually
        have a strategy that we must follow to beat them and it is not enough to
        simply hit them many times. In addition, we should avoid almost all the
        hits, because especially in the last bosses they are deadly, unless we
        have enough hearts that then maybe we can withstand 2-3 hits.

      <p class="text text9">
        "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" could be described as a
        "Masterpiece" for fans of the series and not only. It provides us with
        endless material to explore, even after its completion, which is
        provided relatively early for those in a hurry. A few minor issues
        encountered by the title (which have been fixed through various updates)
        are the only reason this game can't reach the maximum rating.
